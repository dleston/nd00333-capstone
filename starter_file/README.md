# Predicting annual income of neighborhoods of Madrid
This project aims to demonstrate the kwnoledge acquired throughout Udacity's AzureML Engineer Nanodegree.


## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
For this project, we have selected an open dataset fetched from https://datos.madrid.es/portal/site/egob/menuitem.c05c1f754a33a9fbe4b2e4b284f1a5a0/?vgnextoid=71359583a773a510VgnVCM2000001f4a900aRCRD&vgnextchannel=374512b9ace9f310VgnVCM100000171f5a0aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default

It compiles socioeconomic information for all neighborhoods in Madrid. Information about families living in the neighborhood, their family members, their studies, the age of the buildings, number of schools, number of libraries, number of sport facilities, average age, number of kids, etcetera.

The target variable is the average annual income of a family given the characteristics of the neighborhood.

### Task
The aim of the project is to develop a machine learning model that will predict the annual income of the average home in the neighborhood. It is a regression task. 
### Access
The dataset was uploaded to the workspace, and consumed both in the notebook (for display purposes) as well as in the train.py script. In order to access the dataset, we need to give context to the python enviroment of which workspace to use.

## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
